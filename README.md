# DATA_paper_MSTLengthRatios
R codes to develop paper of MST Lengths of financial indices.

As input to the code we need csv file with finantial indices along the time (could be in weeks or days). As output we get the time series of MST length among all indices.



Let me explain some files here:

* data070319.csv: csv file just for the first testing. Includes some finatial indices measures (shares and bonds). These data are used for testing purposes in trying.R
* data150419.csv: csv file indicating daily returns of different finantial indices. 
* data170419.csv: csv file indicating weekly returns of different finantial indices. 
* trying_v2.R: R code to get the MST length from data150419.csv and data170419.csv.
